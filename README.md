# Gesture-Recognition

## Data augmentation 

This branch is to data augment your images. It will go through each image and augment it once until the `target_augmented` is reached. 

You must create a `Data` folder or chose a name of your choice. If you create a folder with a different name, then change the `data_dir` to the name of the folder.

The `Data` folder must contain subfolder which act as classes. 

`target_augmented` is the number of augmented data that you want to collect.

# Gesture-Recognition

## Data augmentation 

This branch is to data augment your images. 

You must create a `Data` folder or chose a name of your choice. If you create a folder with a different name, then change the `data_dir` to the name of the folder.

`target_augmented` is the number of augmented data that you want to collect.

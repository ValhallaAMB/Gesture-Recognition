# Data Collection 

This branch is collects data from your web cam, and saves the image in a directory (default `Data/...`).

The images' size is 300x300 with an offset of 20 if the hand does not fix in the bound box

After installing the `requirements.txt` in a virtual environment and running the python file, you will be able to collect data by pressing and holding down the assigned key (e.g. `B`: This key is configurable). 

The program will stop collecting images after reaching a certain threshold (This is configurable).

This branch consists of the frontend integration + the current recognition logic at the time of creation (subject to change)

Run guide
1. Tested using Python 3.10.1 (please test with 3.11.9 as I think that's what you two are using currently)
2. Create venv using python -m venv venv
3. Open terminal and access venv using venv/Scripts/Activate
4. Run pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Deactivate venv from terminal using deactivate
6. Run main.py from terminal using python main.py OR using python launcher in VS code

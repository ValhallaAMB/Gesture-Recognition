# Notes

1. I created two separate .venv: one for `action-recognition` and another for `gesture-recognition`.
2. Be sure to create and select a .venv inside their corresponding folder using the `requirements.txt` file, since both of them have different dependencies.
3. To run them: make sure the terminal's path is in the correct project directory.
